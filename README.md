IPA Size Analysis

This analysis compares the size of two IPA files: ios_client_before_integration.ipa and ios_client_after_integration.ipa.

Findings

The total IPA size increased by X MB.

Breakdown of the increase:

Binary size increased by Y MB.

Asset changes contributed Z MB.

Additional dependencies added W MB.

Architecture Impact

The integration introduced A, B, and C components that contributed to the increase.

Debug symbols and unused assets were identified as potential optimization areas.

Recommendations

Optimize asset compression.

Strip unnecessary symbols.

Use Bitcode for better App Store optimization.

Check for redundant dependencies.

Usage

Run the following command to compare IPA sizes:

python3 compare_ipa.py ios_client_before_integration.ipa ios_client_after_integration.ipa output_dir

This will generate a detailed report in output_dir. Analyze the results to identify further optimization opportunities.
